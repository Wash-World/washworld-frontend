📝 types/
What goes here:
Global TypeScript types and interfaces.

Examples:

User.ts – interface User { id: string; email: string; }

Wash.ts – type WashStatus = 'scheduled' | 'in_progress' | 'done'

Navigation.ts – type-safe stack/tab param lists

ApiResponse.ts – consistent API response shapes

Tip: you can also create index.ts files that re-export everything in that folder, e.g. types/index.ts exports all your types.
