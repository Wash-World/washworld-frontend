What goes here:
Custom React hooks — reusable logic abstracted out of components.

Examples:

useAuth.ts – checks login state or provides current user

useForm.ts – shared form logic for handling input/validation

useWashFlow.ts – maybe handles step transitions in wash flow

useDebounce.ts – debounce a value before triggering API calls
